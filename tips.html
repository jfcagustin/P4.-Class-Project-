            <div class="tip">
                <p>The different parts you allocate your budget towards matters, and differs based on what you want your computer to do.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
                <p>If you want to build a gaming computer, I would say that the parts depend on the types of games you want to play. Some games are more CPU or GPU intensive than one another. However, focusing most of the budget on a strong CPU and GPU will show its benefits in gameplay. In terms of gaming, there should be an 8GB minimum for RAM. You should add more RAM depending on your needs. For example, if you would like to stream alongside gaming, 16GB of RAM would be more desirable. Aside from the amount of RAM, the speed also plays a factor. If you are using an AMD chip, faster memory speeds will show even more performance than with an Intel chip.</p>
                <img src="images/budget.jpg" alt="calculator and coins" id="img-1" style="border: black 1px solid">
                <p><br>If you want to build a workstation computer meant for things such as Computer Aided Design, you would also want to have a strong CPU and GPU. However, you would want to focus on having more cores and threads in the CPU to handle more processes. In addition to this, you would want a GPU with more computing power and virtual RAM. An example of this would be choosing an NVIDIA Quadro Series card meant for workflow as opposed to an NVIDIA GeForce Series Card which are more meant for gaming. In terms of RAM, at least 16GB would be a recommended minimum for a workstation, but having 32GB or more would show noticeable performance in tasks such as rendering, editing, etc.</p>
                    <p><br>All of these are subject to change based on your specific needs! However, I recommend anyone at any budget point to have an SSD in their system.</p>

                <p>Lighting can make your PC stand out, especially if used correctly. To make each major component pop, there should be lighting concentrated in certain areas as opposed to having the whole inside of the computer lit up. Not only could having some dark spots hide some poor cable management, but it just makes those certain lit up parts look that much more special. You could also add in LED strips or LED fans to brighten up the system.</p>
                    <p><br>Toys, figurines, etc. can add a splash of personality to your computer. Some popular toys that people tend to include in their system are Funko POP! figures, model cars, or whatever they desire. As picture din the computer gallery, toys are a common occurrence in the computers that I build.</p>
                <p><br>As pictured, this computer enthusiast chose to not only have lighting on his components like his RAM, GPU, and CPU water block in his custom loop, but he also decided to include some LED strips.</p>
